copied from  varun:  bend_grass/openbc/romate_bkup.

This works, but large h is produced at the outlet ad periodically released. 
To check if this is due to the outflow bc, I rerun in a longer domain.
Fails in larger domain. 

On looking carefully, I see that ufbce was not changed in openbc_romate, but 
commented out. 

I want to reintroduce that. 

cufu computed in vcenter. This is aflux. Then calculate cx at exit, and 
ufbce at exit. 
Not usable because cufu (using romate) is completely off the mark -- (v diff. 
uf , an order of mag larger and of + or - sign)

doesnt work. I've tried a simple fix in openbc,
            ufbce(j,k)= 2.d0*uf(NI-1,j,k)-uf(NI-2,j,k)
which runs,  but does not solve the problem properly.

Create a new openbc that finds cufu based on fluxes


add computation of cufh to vhydro
Then use h(i+1) calculated in openbc as bc
change hbc_openbc.f hfill_openbc.f , chfine_openbc.f
None of this works. 

Go back to keeping ufbce. 

commenting out uf = ufbce in openbc - and still works. fine.

Try to find an advection speed for uf and use this. 

In momentum, set ufbce to uf, before next time step
don't get the right h grad at i=NI faces so 
In hfill, use extrapolotion to fill h at NI+1 -- didn't work

Put correction for h at the end of vface.
Doesn't work -- high freq. oscillations in h grow
Unstable because it is not semi-implicit (only one time level).
Doesn't make sense to put it here, while it is fine in vhydro.


ufbce was set to uf at beginning of momentum
now set it to uf - csp*( uf(NI - uf(NI-1))
This doesn't work - go back to the Mar23 version where ufbce is set to uf
at the beginning of momentum.

Correct h -- now hxn should be from level 0 of the RK scheme
Also change h solution so as to use the convergence of uf(n=0 level) and cxf
to calculate dh/dt.

Works - some oscillations in h  so kappa may need to be adjusted.
Mar 25  - h oscillations subside with time, until blow up at 10,000 steps.

Mar 26 - try kappah = 0.75, also use updated ufbce. 
Kappa= 0.75 helps, but not the updated ufbce

Compar Mar23 and Mar25 : Not too different . 
Both set ufbce = uf at the beginning of momentum. 
Mar25 version - used hxn and uf from 0 level of RK. 
Mar23 version used hxn and uf from most recent level of RK

Mar26 - kappa=0.75  (updating ufbce with wave sp doesn't work)
Try to smooth out h at the boundary by using some upwinding. 
1) in intpol.f  use interpolation to get cxf , instead of setting it to ufbce
at East bndry.
2)in vhydro_openbc             if (i.eq.NI) then
               hxi= 2.0*h(NI,j) -3.d0*h(NI-1,j) +h(NI-2,j)  does not work

inpol from interior works.
Try using dh/dx inside for vhydro -doesn't work
Try extrapolating h in hfill.f  - doesn't work

p at exit in grassy layer is zigzag. 
Smooth external p in mgpfill_  does not work

in viscous_grass  -there was no x -dire visc. Put this back. 

Make Cd=0, to test - amplifies problems.  Put back Cd


rerun Mar26----
leave ufbce constant throughout
viscosity in x direction
intpol - leave extrapolation on
put kappa=0.65 back

-----------
put back code from bkup_worksNI96
viscosity in x added
use intpol_3rdorder.f
works fine

Now change ufbce to be average of values in channel
output in Mar26

This seems to work the best. 

Try changing dH with time, - interpolate between dHinit and dHfinal. updatedH
When dH is changed , but uf is not, then h just does the opposite of dH and 
the velociteis stay the same with time. Result in Mar26_dH


Modify updatedh.f to update u and uf along the channel. This seems not to work. 
If I do it very slowly it works for 2000 time steps. 
Mar28_

Do a run with dH=.3d-2, comment out updatedH

works fine -- can update inflow bc since dH is prescribed. 

Mar30
Try commenting out grassshape for rigid plants. 
generated vortices at similar freq.  Put back grassshape

Mar30 wide channel , make NJ=48 -- makes no difference. 
Need to add y advec and bending.

Apr6 inflex_dH3long  -run rigid dowels in long channel
for rigid dowels, remove call to grassbend

Try reducing drho.  drho=10, dh.3 doesn't work. drho=50 also doesn't work
drho=50 doesn't work even with dH.1

Apr7_deep4.8m   Make total depth 4.8 m and double the grid points in the vertical. 
Doesn't work. 
Clearly, Kz is too big

Try changing vmu to 1.d-5
but grassshape crashes if I do -- velocities are too large. 

In the deep channel velocities become too large, reduce dH to 0.1d-2
surface velocities 60cm/s  - crashes

Try dH=0.03d-2   Apr17_deep4.8m_dH.03,  didn't work --
now the velocity in the grass bed is too low - 

Change depth to 3.6 m, and use dH=0.1

Still doesn't work. U is decreasing down channel, but the outflow BC uses
aveerage over a large part of the length. Restrict average to the last few points.

Deep water doesn't work -- p is very high everywhere, h is wrong, w is very large. 

I've noticed that vmu=1.d-4 in steadystate, but Kzmax= 1.d-5 in vdiffusion. 
Try making Kzmax= 1.d-4 in vdiffusion  -didn't help. 

Can't get the deep flow to work - If depth=2.4m - works. If depth=2.6 m, works, if depth= 2.8m  doesn't work - 
=====

Copied over from niak. 
grassLen= 1.2m, depth=2.4 m.  zNL = 10 (insetead of 100)

=== July 12, 2010 
test the code. 
Does not shed KH instab
replace openbc_romate  with openbc_fix where the outflow bndry is taken
from the middle of the channel - this works

Increase grid spacing to make channel longer - and KH shedding is fine
